# Data Analysis: Data Integration

## Learning Outcomes

Learners will acquire the fundamental skills needed to perform data integration tasks in Python. Through guided examples and exercises, participants will learn how to integrate datasets by determining an integrated schema, matching and transforming data for that schema, performing entity resolution, and resolving conflicts. They will gain proficiency in using dataframes to perform data integration tasks. Specific outcomes include:

1. Be able to join dataframes together
2. Be able to perform schema matching and mapping
3. Be able to resolve entities across dataframes
4. Be able to use probabilistic record linkage for entity resolution
5. Be able to identify and fill missing values
6. Be able to combine matching entities into a single row
7. Be able to resolve conflicting values using different strategies
